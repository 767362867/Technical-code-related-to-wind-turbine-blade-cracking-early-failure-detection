Detection tasks based on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data are challenging because of the following problems: (i) high redundancy and high non-linearity of data complicate the detection task; (ii) because the sheer volume of data, the current methods are hard to accurately detect useful early fault information from raw data. We propose to use a method called parallel multiple CNNs with temporal predictions (PMCTP) for wind turbine blade cracking early fault detection.
Different from the traditional single-branch input, PMCTP is designed with two mixed branches with parallel inputs (SCADA data from one branch goes directly to feature extraction and SCADA data from the other branch goes through TCN for prediction before entering feature extraction). Because of the high redundancy, high non-linearity, and excessive data from wind turbines, pre-processing of the data is required. In the proposed network model, pre-processed data on the four categories of state parameters of the wind turbine are fed into ResNet50 and Xception, respectively for adaptive feature extraction. The classification probabilities obtained from parallel 8-branch feature extraction are then sent to multiple fully connected layers for fusion.
